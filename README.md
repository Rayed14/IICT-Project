# IICT-Project
This is my IICT (Intro to Information and Communication Technologies) project, in this project we had to make a website using only HTML and CSS. 

HOW TO RUN:
  - Open the HTML folder and find the index.html file
  - Open it in the web browser and enjoy the interactive app

Thank You
